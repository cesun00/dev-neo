The Laboratory Module is DEC's first revenue-generating product line.
They are PCB of basic logical circuits (like AND gates or a flip-flop) encapsulated in a metal box
which expose banana plugs interface.
Laboratory Module were meant to be settled on an engineer's desk,
although rack-mounting chassis were also being sold which allows 
the installatoin of 9 modules in a 3U row of a 19-inch rack.

Most DLM are synchronized digital circuit where a clock must be provided.
(DEC also had a clock generator module.) These modules usually 
comes in 500 kilocycle, 5 megacycle and 10 megacycle versions for users to choose from.
