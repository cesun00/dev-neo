DEC Modules
==============

## 1st gen: Laboratory Module (early 1958)

The Laboratory Module is DEC's first revenue-generating product line.
They are PCB of basic logical circuits (like AND gates or a flip-flop) encapsulated in a metal box
which expose banana plugs interface.
Laboratory Module were meant to be settled on an engineer's desk,
although rack-mounting chassis were also being sold which allows 
the installatoin of 9 modules in a 3U row of a 19-inch rack.

Most DLM are synchronized digital circuit where a clock must be provided.
(DEC also had a clock generator module.) These modules usually 
comes in 500 kilocycle, 5 megacycle and 10 megacycle versions for users to choose from.

## 2nd gen: System Module (System Building Blocks)

DEC's second product line is the System Building Blocks, which are rebranded as *System Module* c. 1961. They are internally identical to DLM, i.e. basic digital circuit components, but use a different, compact package. The banana plug interface is replaced with 22 gold-plated discrete pins along one edge, a standard connector type designed by Amphenol. (this company still exist as of 2024.)

System Modules are used to bulid PDP-1 to PDP-7, though PDP-7 used some FLIP CHIPs as well.

`System Building Blocks` was printed on the edge https://gunkies.org/wiki/File:PDP-6_mod_end.jpg

To use such card-shaped modules, one need to plug them into a backplane which could be mounted in a 19-inch rack.
The backplanes allowed 25 modules

> If you plug 20 modules into a backplane, the first pin of all modules is connected, so is the second pin, etc.
> This forming multiple computer buses, one for each pin position.

## 3rd gen: FLIP CHIP

FLIP CHIP was designed in 1964 as components of and enhancement to the PDPâ€“7 computer.

The R series which operates from DC to Two Megahertz.
2. The B series which operates from DC to Ten Megahertz.
3. The W series modules for interfacing with various types of external equipment

4000-Series: the second series, nominally 500 KHz, but some 1 MHz[4]
1000-Series: the original series, nominally 5 MHz[5]
6000-Series: higher speeds, nominally 10 Mhz[6]
8000-Series: very high speeds, nominally 30MHz[7]


## The reference manul

The official manual of DLM and System Module was the *Digital Logic Handbook*.
The first edition was released in September 1960.
Some of them are available at the [bitsavers](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/handbooks/)


PDP-1
========

Digital used their existing line of logic modules to build a PDP
and aimed it at a market that could not afford the GIGANTIC computers.

Such "existing line of logic modules"

The stock installation of PDP-1 is simply 4 19-inch racks.
Everything else, e.g. the keyboard, the printer, and [the iconic circle CRT display](https://www.soemtron.org/pdp7optionslist.html#opt30) is considered peripheral devices.

There were totally 53 PDP-1 built and delivered, from the first in 1959 to the last one in 1969.
