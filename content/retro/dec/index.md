DEC Modules
==============

## 1st gen: Laboratory Module (early 1958)

The Laboratory Module is DEC's first revenue-generating product line.
They are basic logical circuit components (like AND gates or a flip-flop) encapsulated in a metal box.
These boxes were intended to sit on a workbench or be installed into rack chassis and mounted in a 19-inch rack, interconnected with banana plugs and jump wires.

width:height:depth = `1-3/4 : 4-1/2 : 7` inches in size

three speed ranges were 5 MHz (1957), 500 kHz (1959), and 10 MHz (1960).

Most DLM are synchronized digital circuit where a clock must be provided.
(DEC also had a clock generator module.) These modules usually 
comes in 500 kilocycle, 5 megacycle and 10 megacycle versions for users to choose from. -->

## 2nd gen: System Module (System Building Blocks)

DEC's second product line is the System Building Blocks, which were re-branded as the *System Module*
in 1961.
Their internal circuits were identical to the Laboratory Modules but used a more compact package.
Instead of using a banana plug interface in the front, System Modules has 22 gold-plated discrete pins (the Amphenol 143-22-01 connector) in the backside. System Modules are meant to be plugged into a [wire-wrapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_wrap) *backplane*.

> The term backplane back in the 1960s simply refer to an insulated mounting board instead of a PCB in nowadays'sense. Such backplanes had no trace but only punched holes for the fixation of equipment.
Connectivity is established by wire-wrapping in the backside of the board, leaving a clean
and tidy front view of the equipment. Such wire-wrapped backplane exists from PDP-1 to PDP-7,
also in `PDP-8` (1965), `PDP-8/S` (1966), `PDP-8/I` and `PDP-8/L` (1968), `PDP-12` (1969), 
and was finally replaced by the OMNIBUS system bus in `PDP-8/E` (1970).

System Modules were used to bulid PDP-1 to PDP-7, though PDP-7 used some FLIP CHIPs as well.

`System Building Blocks` was printed on the edge https://gunkies.org/wiki/File:PDP-6_mod_end.jpg

To use such card-shaped modules, one need to plug them into a backplane which could be mounted in a 19-inch rack.
The backplanes allowed 25 modules

> If you plug 20 modules into a backplane, the first pin of all modules is connected, so is the second pin, etc.
> This forming multiple computer buses, one for each pin position.

## 3rd gen: FLIP CHIP

FLIP CHIP was designed in 1964 as components of and enhancement to the PDPâ€“7 computer.

- The `R series` which operates from DC to 2 Megahertz.
- The `B series` which operates from DC to 10 Megahertz.
- The `W series` modules for interfacing with various types of external equipment

- 4000-Series: the second series, nominally 500 KHz, but some 1 MHz
- 1000-Series: the original series, nominally 5 MHz
- 6000-Series: higher speeds, nominally 10 Mhz
- 8000-Series: very high speeds, nominally 30MHz


## The reference manul

The official manual of DLM and System Module was the *Digital Logic Handbook*.
The first edition was released in September 1960.
Some of them are available at the [bitsavers](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/handbooks/)


PDP-1
========

Digital used their existing line of logic modules to build a PDP
and aimed it at a market that could not afford the GIGANTIC computers.

Such "existing line of logic modules"

The stock installation of PDP-1 is simply 4 19-inch racks.
Everything else, e.g. the keyboard, the printer, and [the iconic circle CRT display](https://www.soemtron.org/pdp7optionslist.html#opt30) is considered peripheral devices.

There were totally 53 PDP-1 built and delivered, from the first in 1959 to the last one in 1969.
