DEC Modules
==============

## 1st gen: Laboratory Module (early 1958)

The Laboratory Module is DEC's first revenue-generating product line.
They are basic logical circuit components (like AND gates or a flip-flop) encapsulated in a metal box.
These boxes were intended to sit on a workbench or be installed into rack chassis and mounted in a 19-inch rack, interconnected with banana plugs and jump wires.

width:height:depth = `1-3/4 : 4-1/2 : 7` inches in size

three speed ranges were 5 MHz (1957), 500 kHz (1959), and 10 MHz (1960).

the installatoin of 9 modules in a 3U row of a 19-inch rack.


Most DLM are synchronized digital circuit where a clock must be provided.
(DEC also had a clock generator module.) These modules usually 
comes in 500 kilocycle, 5 megacycle and 10 megacycle versions for users to choose from. -->

## 2nd gen: System Module (System Building Blocks)
