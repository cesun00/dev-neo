The "Research Unix" Era
==============

The Multics project was led by 

Research Unix is the collective name of various edition of the original Unix developed by Ken, Dennis et al.

You are looking at a combination of 3 entities: a profit-making company, a research institution and a college.
Such a heterogeneous composition

So the Bell Lab withdrew. This leaves the researchers nothing to do.
They just went through a great promising project which failed due to 
management and terrible design, and they definitely thought they cna do better.

If you are a REAL engineer who at least once want to refactor any terrible subroutine, that's the feeling.

Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie Brian Kernighan, 

It's rarely mentioned on the Internet Community how the Bell Lab management thought about their off-time project.
They are paid employees from the research department of a profit-making company.
Ken and Dennis spent quite a bit of time trying to convince the management purchasing a 

Bell just withdrew from a failed investment 

At that moment there was an idle [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation) [PDP-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-7)
mainframe

The management was finally convinced and cobble together enough money to buy Ken a brand new (in 1972) `PDP-11/20`.
50K dollars was spent. Ken et al promised to write a in-exchanged to this proposal ... geez

which will benefits the Bell Lab's patent department to do generate patent application in official  far more easily than 
the existing commercial word processing system.
This is the `roff` program, which soon evolved into the `troff` program you have on your
current Linux distro, nowadays an alias to the GNU's `groff`:

```sh
# which troff
/usr/bin/troff
```


In 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in the higher-level language C,


The Unix operating system was first presented formally to the outside world at the 1973 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP, Oct 15-17), where Ritchie and Thompson delivered a paper;

AT&T licensed Version 5 to educational institutions in 1973, and Version 6 also to commercial sites in ...
Schools paid $200 and others $20,000.

Anyone could purchase a license, but the terms were very restrictive; licensees only received the source code, on an as-is basis
(i.e. no support, no refunds, no warranty, and no maintenance).

The $20000 price and such zero-service terms made V6 considerably .
But there are still companies felt "the improved productivity achieved with Unix was worth the fee".

but a few firms 


By the year 1974, Unix was entirely unsupported by AT&T, making the user group the de-facto maintainer of Unix.


Versions of the Unix system were determined by editions of its user manuals;

The Bell Labs developers did not think in terms of "releases" of the operating system, instead using a model of continuous development, and sometimes distributing tapes with patches (without AT&T lawyers' approval).

In 1978, UNIX/32V was released for DEC's then new VAX system. We are looking at over 600 machines were running Unix in some form around the world.
