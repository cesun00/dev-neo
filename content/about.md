## About this site

This site is statically generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a theme of mine.

There are some rationales for the arrangement of content that might help you in navigating this site:

1. A section page is a navigation node like a folder, but it can have its own text content. Miscellaneous information about a topic not worth a standalone page is put on the section page.
2. Sections can be nested; e.g. [GNU/Linux]({{<ref "./linux/_index.md">}}) contains general discussion about the GNU/Linux ecosystem and has a nested section [kernel]({{<ref "./linux/kernel/_index.md">}}) with Linux-kernel specific analysis. A parent section contains listing of both its own articles and articles in all sub-sections

Hope you have fun exploring this place.
