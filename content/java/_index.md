## Administrative Processes

### The Java Community Process (JCP) Program {#jcp}

The JCP program is the public process via which JSR documents are reviewed and promoted from a draft to a standard.
JCP represents the effort to turn Java from an Oracle-owned property to a community-driven & open-source programming language.

The program is hosted at: https://www.jcp.org/en/home/index.
Anyone can register for the site and participate in reviewing and providing feedback for the Java Specification Requests (JSRs).
