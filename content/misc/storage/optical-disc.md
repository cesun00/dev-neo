This article is an overview of optical storage devices,
including their history, their physical specifications, the design idea and its underlying physics rationale,
and the manufacturing techniques in order to implement the design.

## History

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_recording


The development history of disc is a chaotic one. Basically everyone was getting ideas from vinyl disc,
such that their design is and patents doesn't .

The real great leap in this technology is the exploitation of phase cancellation.

The invention of optical disc recording didn't come out of the blue.
Researchers in the 1960s had long been influenced by the design of vinyl and the idea of recording sound by making scratches
on an otherwise flat surface. An optical disc is really the laser-using counterpart of a vinyl.

- In 1958, David Paul Gregg devised an analog optical disc used for video recording.

    The design is 

    The concept of spiral track dates back to David's design. He was thinking about a 1 micrometer track and gap, comparing
    to the modern 500nm track and a 1.6 um 

    Under United States patent law, the term of patent, provided that maintenance fees are paid on time, is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest U.S. or international (PCT) application

- In 1966, James T. Russell filed a patent for storing digital signals on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp. The patent was granted in 1970 and finally [gave away to Sony and Philips](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20041129&slug=cdman29) in the 1980s for the manufacturing of CDs.

    Contemporary competing media include VHS (1976, Japan) and Betamax  magnetic cassette video tapes.
- Compact Disc (CD), get its name from a previous product line [Compact Cassette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape) of Philips, and reflect the fact that CD is much smaller than a LaserDisc.

## Physical Implementation  

All optical storage device works by emitting a laser beam whose property changes when passing through or being reflected by a surface with TODO.

HUGE amount of material you can find on the Internet misinterpret this.
It is the transition brink of a pit and an edge where the destructive interference happens.
Pits and lands equally reflect laser beam into sensor (it is called the law of reflection). Only at the transition from a pit to a land or land to a pit destructive interference occurs in the reflected laser leading to no or extremely dim beam enters the sensor.  This destructive interference occurs because CDs are made so that the depth difference between a pit and a land is a quarter of wavelength of the laser used.

When the center of the laser spot pass through the transition of a pit and a land, half of the laser traval 
<!-- Both peaks and troughs are 0, where as the transition between both is 1.>? TRUE?  -->

minimum size of the laser spot is proportional to the wavelength of the laser

CIRC and NRZI coding

Essentially a CD works by taking reference to an external synchronzied clock.
This is why - When playing an audio CD, a motor within the CD player spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2â€“1.4 m/s (constant linear velocity, CLV).

## Industrial Manufacturing CD

First, a master disc is made from a glass, hardened by a nickle-vanadium electroforming coated layer.
Then CDs are made by stamping the master disc onto a plastic.

1. A master disc are fabricated using photolithography.
This process is also known as matstering, and the master disc is sometimes simply called a master.

A materail that will either 

1. A circle glass is cleaned with de-ionized water and hair brushes. 
2. It is then send to a rapid spinner to remove water, then cleanness of the surface will be tested with laser by a surface analyzer.
3. 
4. Electroforming
5. stamping out machine remove excessive material (glass and nickle / vanaidum)

The reflective layer is formed by heating alluminium in an vacuumed chamber.
The vaporization point of metal is low, and easy.
