## History

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_recording


The development history of disc is a chaotic one. Basically everyone was getting ideas from vinyl disc,
such that their design is and patents doesn't .

The real great leap in this technology is the exploitation of phase cancellation.

The invention of optical disc recording didn't come out of the blue.
Researchers in the 1960s had long been influenced by the design of vinyl and the idea of recording sound by making scratches
on an otherwise flat surface. An optical disc is really the laser-using counterpart of a vinyl.
