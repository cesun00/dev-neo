Color is like probability theory. Everything feels natural until you can't convince yourself.
There are more biology and math in the organization of color in software palette than you think.

Cone cells in vertebrates' eyes are sensitive to electromagnetic waves of a certain wavelength range.
A human's eye has 6 to 7 million cone cells, 
There are 3 types of them, namely type L, M, and S, which got their names from long, medium, and short wavelength.  

{{<figure src="./Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg" caption="Response strength of 3 cone cell types by wavelength.">}}

- L cone cells respond to all wavelengths from 400nm to 700nm but are most sensitive to 564–580 nm. (red)
- M cone cells respond to wavelengths from 400nm to 650nm but are most sensitive to 534–545 nm. (green)
- S cone cells respond to wavelengths from 400nm to 550nm but are most sensitive to 420–440 nm. (blue)

The brain synthesizes a color depending on which cone cells are sending signals and their strength.
For a fixed wavelength, the strength of the signal sent by a given type of cone cell is proportional to the intensity (amplitude) of that electromagnetic wave.
