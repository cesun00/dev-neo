> A transistor is just a variable resistor whose resistance is adjustable not by hand but by electricity.

A transistor is any device with 3 (or more - see below) terminals where the voltage (thus current) between one pair of terminals controls the current (thus effective resistance) flowing through another pair of terminals. This nice controllability allows a transistor to be used as a *switch* of current, turned on and off also by electricity.

Multiple implementations of the idea of the transistor exist, based on different physical rationales.

1. bipolar junction transistor (BJT)

    The 3 terminals of an BJT are named *base, collector and emitter*.

    A small current at the base terminal, flowing between the base and the emitter, can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter.

2. field-effect transistor (FET)

    FET, a.k.a unipolar transistor, is a division of transistors that only use 1 type of charge carrier (either electron or hole).

    3 termianls of an FET is named *gate, source and drain*.
    A voltage at the gate can control a current between source and drain
    
    Sub-division of FET includes:
    1. MOS-FET (metal-oxide-semiconductor FET)
