## resistor / resistance & conductance

- *resistance* measures an object's opposition to the flow of current through it.
- *conductance* is the reciprocal of resistance. (unit: `mho â„§`)

The electrical component that provides resistance is called a *resistor*.

## inductor / inductance

When the current (strength) through an object changes (e.g. in an AC circuit), *inductance* measures the object's ability to oppose such change.
Unit of inductance is `henry (H)`. Customary symbol for inductance is `L`.

The electrical component that provides resistance is called an *inductor*.
Inductors are made by winding insulated wire into a coil, optionally wrapping around a *magnetic core* (i.e. a magnet field waveguide, usually an iron or ferrite cylinder).

The ultimate reason of inductor to oppose the change of current, is its coiling structure being sensitive to change of magnetic flux due to the change of current strength.
An EMF is generated to alleviate the change of magnetic flux, governed by the Lenz's law, which is opposite to the change of current in the first place.

 through the circuit, governed by the Faraday's law of induction.

- From high level, inductor can be seen as an component that stores energy in magnetic field  when ... TODO
- In DC circuit the current is constant, thus an inductor provides no inductance, and behaves like a wire (perhaps with only resistance).

## capacitor / capacitance

*Capacitance* measures an object's ability to accommodate charges.
It takes more charges (thus, more charging time) for a high capacitance object to reach electrostatic equilibrium when attached to a cathode / anode.

When 2 objects have different net charge, electric potential drops from the positive one to the negative one, i.e. voltage exists.
