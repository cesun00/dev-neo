## The `HOSTS.TXT` file

Each computer on the ARPANET must retrieve the `HOSTS.TXT` file from a computer at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI - now SRI International).
This file was manually maintained by [Jon Postel, et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5986499) at the USC's Information Sciences Institute (ISI), containing the mapping from hostnames to addresses of hosts, which are contributed for inclusion by member organizations.
The syntax of this file is identical to the modern `/etc/hosts`.

### Domain Name System

The DNS was first described in 1983 and implemented in 1984. 
DNS automated the publication process and provided instantaneous and dynamic hostname resolution in the rapidly growing network.


<!-- As with all domains and registrars, we are required to publish information concerning your domain through a publicly available service called WHOIS. The WHOIS service allows anybody to view information such as your name, email, address, phone number, when the domain was registered and when it expires. Unfortunately, spammers have taken advantage of this WHOIS requirement which almost invariably results in SPAM directed at the information found within WHOIS. We therefore offer the following options to protect your information: • No Privacy (Free) All of your information will be made available through WHOIS • WHOIS Privacy (Free) With this option, we will use our default information for all applicable WHOIS fields. This will hide all of your "real" information from WHOIS. Please be sure to read the section on domain privacy options within our terms of service when choosing this option. Please keep in mind that you may also change your privacy settings at any time after your order has been placed. -->
