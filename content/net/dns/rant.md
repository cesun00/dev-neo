DNS was designed by pedantics.
Many confusion can be avoided by using not reusing the same protocol format and identify heterogeneous components.

This may serve a clarified paraphrase of from a modern perspective, removing the unimportant and even misleading statements


## Abuses of Terms (which are too late to be fixed)

DNS is perhaps the system with the most abused terminologies.
People frequently are asking about 

The term `name servers` originally only meant authoritative ones, while non-authoritative DNS servers
are known as `resolvers`. Nowadays some software when requiring a full-service resolver to work simply asks users to 
give them the address of a name server, including the `/etc/resolv.conf` file on which GLIBC depends:

```conf
# Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 116.228.111.118
nameserver 180.168.255.18
```
