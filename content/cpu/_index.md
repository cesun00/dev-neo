All about CPUs.

## glossary

Control unit. Within which:
1. instruction unit (IU) / instruction fetch unit (IFU) / instruction issue unit (IIU) / instruction sequencing unit (ISU)
2. execution unit.
3. Microarchitecture: the technique to design a specific range of CPU, determining how components are interconneted with each other.
   1. e.g. Intel Core 2, Intel Skylake and AMD Zen4 are all different Microarchitectures.
4. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

    An ISA is the collective name of well-defined
    1. instructions (semantics, encoding format, opcode and operands, addressing mode)
    2. data types (sign/unsigned byte/(d|q|dq)?word, floating, pointer, etc.)
    3. registers
    4. main memory requirement & management

    e.g. IA32, x86 and 

## Memory Controller

Sometimes, Memory Controller Unit (MCU); don't get confused with Microcontroller Unit (also, MCU).

Memory Controller is the part of circuits that directly controls the memory (data and address) bus
