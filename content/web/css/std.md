## CSS Levels and Modules

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994. The primary duty of the W3C is to develop technical specifications for HTML5, CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and other technologies.

The original plan for CSS in 1994 - 1995 was to create a feature-rich, but temporary typographical specification language that was good enough for up to 10 years. W3C hoped to observe the reception from the industry and use such an experience to devise the next-generation typography language.

However, the situation did not unfold as anticipated.
It turned out that browser vendors at that time were reluctant / unskilled enough to implement all the planned features. W3C had to compromise and make the specification a lot simpler for it even to be implemented.






The standardization of CSS took a level-based design from the very beginning.
