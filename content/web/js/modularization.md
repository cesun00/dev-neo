<!-- a module = a js file

- is it possible to hide a name completely? 

    leverage the fact that function local variable can't be referred after function exit - use a immediately executed unnamed function

1. how dependencies among modules are expressed?
    3. is it possible / convenient for langauge server to identify the relationship
2. any tooling that respect the expressed dependencies relationship? Or manually `<script>` ordering still required? -->
