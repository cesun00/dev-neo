The `Makefile` language can be divided into 2 parts, a dependency description language,
and a scripting language including constructs like functions, variables, loops, branching etc.

The purpose of the scripting part of a Makefile is to
1. determine the value of variables at run time, which can be expanded in the dependency part.
2. conditionally enable or disable certain rules in the dependency part

The mixture of 2 languages in the same `Makefile` renders it a rather weird creature for beginners.

## include other makefiles

The `include` and `-include` directive instructs the parser to parse the mentioned files as if their content replaces the `include` directive. (Not really, see below.) The parsing of the current file is paused until the replacement is done. There is no more ad-hoc treatment.

This indicates that the paths (including targets and dependencies) within the `include`-ed files are interpreted relative to the CWD of the `make` process that is parsing the `include`-ing Makefile.

```makefile
# Multiple files can appear in the same directive, order respected.
# wildcard works
include Makefile.other foo *.mk $(bar)

# the `-include` variant won't cause an error if mentioned files is not found
# Read auto.conf if it exists, otherwise ignore
-include include/config/auto.conf
```

If the specified file name does not start with a slash (i.e. a relative path),
- it is located relative to the CWD; if not found,
- it is searched in the directories given by the `.INCLUDE_DIRS` variable, which is populated by
    1. path supplied by the `-I` option
    2. path hardcoded into the `make` program at its build time

Eventually,
1. If the included file is found, its current content is read (which may contain rules to remake itself), without immediately considering its up-to-date-ness;
2. If the included file is still not found, it's not immediately an error. In some workflow, the Makefile is generated from some other source.

Once Make has finished reading Makefiles, it will try to remake any that are out of date or don't exist.
Make will raise a fatal error only after no rule is found to remake a non-existing Makefile.
This means Make needs to distinguish between files, instead of simply replacing `include` with the file content.

In the following example from the Linux kernel, the rules to remake `include/config/auto.conf` and `include/config/auto.conf.cmd` will be triggered before including these 2 files if the `$(KCONFIG_CONFIG)` (expands to `.config`) file has been modified after the previous generation of these 2 files.

```makefile
include include/config/auto.conf
include include/config/auto.conf.cmd

%/config/auto.conf %/config/auto.conf.cmd %/generated/autoconf.h %/generated/rustc_cfg: $(KCONFIG_CONFIG)
	$(Q)$(kecho) "  SYNC    $@"
	$(Q)$(MAKE) -f $(srctree)/Makefile syncconfig
else
```

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

A `Makefile` contains the following of constructs:

{{<boldlist>}}

1. explicit rules

    See...

2. condition structures

2. variable definitions

    A variable definition is a line that specifies a text string value for a variable that can be substituted into the text later.

4. directives

    A directive is an instruction for make to do something special while reading the makefile, including:

    1. Merging the content of another Makefile into the current one (see TODO).
    2. Conditionally use or ignore a part of the Makefile based on the values of variables (see Conditional Parts of Makefiles).
    3. Defining a variable from a verbatim string containing multiple lines (see Defining Multi-Line Variables).

5. comments

    Anywhere in a line, `#` till the next line feed is a comment, except that `\<LF>` can break a comment line as well.

    **Comments are not always ignored:**

    1. Comments within a recipe are passed to the shell, just as with any other recipe text. The shell decides whether this is a comment.
    2. Within a `define` directive, comments are not ignored during the definition of the variable, but rather kept intact in the value of the variable. When the variable is expanded they will either be treated as make comments or as recipe text, depending on the context in which the variable is evaluated.

{{</boldlist>}}

## Recipe Execution

For each logical line, make forks an isolated shell to execute the text on that line.


## Makefile

### Wildcards

Wildcards characters `*`, `?` and `[â€¦]` are supported in 3 context:

- in the target and prerequisite line, wildcards are natively supported by GNU make;
    - In this context, a subtle problem is that, like shell globbing, patterns text like `*.c` are preserved literally when no file are matched, which could cause a problem sometimes, e.g. as prerequisite.
- in recipe lines, each recipe are passed to the shell, and wildcard characters' support are up to the shell;
- in all other places, wildcard expansion must be explicitly requested by the `wildcard` function.

To get a literal asterisk or question mark, use `\*` or `\?`.

```makefile
doStuff: *.c        # make expands
    rm *.o          # shell expands

objects = *.o       # NO expansion. `objects` stores '*.o' literally

output: $(objects)  # `$(objects)` substituted by '*.o', then make expands

# to store all object files in `objects`, use
objects := $(wildcard *.o)      # note the := syntax means to expand RHS immediately
```

### Patterned target & patterned dependency

```makefile
# a rule that are selected for all `make *.c` 

%.c: 
    # the actual invoked target is obtained by `$@`

%.o: %c
    # 
```



Collect file names in a variable with `$(wildcard)` and depend on the expanded result of that variable.


### Empty recipe

```
target: ;
```

## Target Execution & Error Handling


### 2 phase execution

GNU make does its work in two distinct phases.

- During the first phase it reads all the makefiles, included makefiles, etc. and internalizes all the variables and their values and implicit and explicit rules, and builds a dependency graph of all the targets and their prerequisites.
- During the second phase, make uses this internalized data to determine which targets need to be updated and run the recipes necessary to update them.

### shell's involvement

> When it is time to execute recipes to update a target, they are executed by invoking a new sub-shell **for each (logical) line of the recipe**, unless the .`ONESHELL` special target is in effect.
> In practice, make may take shortcuts that do not affect the results.

Implications:
- Conventional multi-line shell constructs (e.g. if/else, loop, etc.) needs to be on the same logical line, e.g.:

    ```makefile
    subdirs:
        for dir in $(SUBDIRS); do \
          $(MAKE) -C $$dir; \
        done;
    ```

VUIR variable `SHELL` controls the exact shell to be used. Value of this makefile variable never inherit from the unix env var `SHELL`.

Value of `.SHELLFLAGS` are passed when fork-exec the shell, and it defaults to `-c`. (which means recipe text will follows.)

## Error
To ignore error (non-zero process return) for certain recipe, prefix with `-`:

## (file) Target / PHONY target

All targets are supposed to be file names, except
- those mentioned as prerequisites of the special built-in target `.PHONY`

    ```makefile
    .PHONY: clean
    clean:
            rm *.o temp
    ```

    This is indeed a weird syntax, reflecting the early coarse design of the Makefile syntax.
    Here is a technique the Linux kernel uses to alleviate the syntax:

    ```makefile
    # declare a variable PHONY
    PHONY := __all

    # incrementally build the PHONY variable 
    PHONY += $(MAKECMDGOALS) __sub-make
    PHONY += $(MAKECMDGOALS) __build_one_by_one
    PHONY += scripts_basic
    PHONY += outputmakefile
    PHONY += all
    PHONY += include/config/auto.conf
    PHONY += prepare0
    # omitting ...

    # finally
    .PHONY: $(PHONY)
    ```

- those not found on the filesystem eventually

The overall idea is that **PHONY targets are ALWAYS considered out-of-date**. This implies:

1. Recipes of a PHONY rule will always run regardless its prerequisites is considered out-of-date or not.
2. If a target has PHONY prerequisites, those PHONY will always

| target(T) \ prerequiresite(P) | file                                     | phony                         |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| file                          | remake T if `mtime` of P is newer than T | P always run; T always remake |
| PHONY                         | T always run                             | P always run; T always run    |


## Types of (file) Prerequisites

2 types of prerequisite exists, but is only interesting when target and prerequisite are both non-PHONY (i.e. normal files).

- order-only prerequisites

    - Prerequisite file must exists before the recipe of this target runs.

- normal prerequisites

    - Prerequisite file must exists before the recipe of this target runs; plus
    - when `modify` time of any normal prerequisites files are newer than that of the target file, the target file must be remade.

That is, semantically, normal prerequisite is a superset of order-only prerequisite.

syntax:

```makefile
targets : normal-prerequisites | order-only-prerequisites
    receipe
    ...
```





Functions
=======================================================================

Function call syntax is identical to variable reference:

```makefile
# both equivalent
$(function arguments)
${function arguments}
```

## vpath buliding

By default, a non-PHONY target / prerequisite name, i.e. file name, is searched only in the current Makefile directory:

```makefile
main.o: main.c      # right in the current directory, or ...
    cc -c main.c

lib/lib.o: lib/lib.c    # with respect to the current directory.
    cc -c -o lib/lib.o lib/lib.c 
```

The idea of the vpath feature is to set more directories as the search root of **both target and preresuisites**.
(resemble the `PATH` envvar so you can refer to binary without fixed absolute path, or java `classpath` stuffs)

### `VPATH` special variable

Directory names separated by **colons or blanks**, searched in order:

```makefile
VPATH = src:../headers      # search pwd first, then src, then ../headers
```

### `vpath` directive

Specify the search directories per file name pattern:

```makefile
vpath pattern directories   # search the colon or blank separated `directories` for file target / prereq whose name matches `pattern`
vpath pattern               # Clear out the search path associated with pattern.
vpath                       # Clear all search paths previously specified with vpath directives.
```

```makefile
vpath %.h ../headers    # search pwd first, then ../headers, but only when `.h` file targets / prerequisites are in question.
```
