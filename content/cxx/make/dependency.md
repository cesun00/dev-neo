The `Makefile` language can be divided into 2 parts, a dependency description language,
and a scripting language including constructs like functions, variables, loops, branching etc.

This article discusses everything about the Dependency Description ability of a Makefile.
See [TODO](#TODO) for the scripting part.

## (Explicit) Rules

The unit of dependency description is *explicit rules* (often, just *rules*). A rule has the following syntax:

```makefile
# each structure below is named a "rule"
target: prerequisites
    recipe

# e.g.
foo.o: foo.c
        $(CC) -Iinclude/ -Iarch/x86/include foo.c
```

An explicit rule describes when and how to remake one or more files, called the ruleâ€™s targets. It lists the other files that the targets depend on, called the prerequisites of the target, and may also give a recipe to use to create or update the targets.
