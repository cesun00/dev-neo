The `Makefile` language can be divided into 2 parts, a dependency description language,
and a scripting language including constructs like functions, variables, loops, branching etc.

This article discusses everything about the Dependency Description ability of a Makefile.
See [TODO](#TODO) for the scripting part.

## (Explicit) Rules

The unit of dependency description is *explicit rules* (often, just *rules*). A rule has the following syntax:

```makefile
# each structure below is named a "rule"
target: prerequisites
    recipe

# e.g.
foo.o: foo.c
        $(CC) -Iinclude/ -Iarch/x86/include foo.c
```

An explicit rule describes when and how to remake one or more files, called the ruleâ€™s targets. It lists the other files that the targets depend on, called the prerequisites of the target, and may also give a recipe to use to create or update the targets.

### the File nature of target

An important assumption in the design of make and Makefile is that: target names are file names.
- 
- This is not always true, as `make all` is invoked from the command line

Targets that are meant to be invoked directly on the command line by the end users are called *goals*.
When `make` is invoked without a goal, a default goal will be invoked: it is the value of special variable `.DEFAULT_GOAL`, or if omitted, the first target whose name doesn't start with `.`.

{{<card "warn">}}

Rules are called explicit if they are present in a `Makefile`, as opposed to *implicit rules* (or sometimes *built-in rules*).

GNU Make attempts to use the following rule 
when `make foo.o` is requested (or used as a dependency) and a `foo.c` file exists, but no rule of making `foo.o` presents in the Makefile:

```makefile
foo.o:
	$(CC) -c foo.c
```

Similarly, a few other implicit rules are hardcoded for other suffixes, e.g. a `bar.c` file from a `bar.l` (lex source) file.
See [the manual page](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Catalogue-of-Rules.html) for an exhaustive list.

Implicit rules are active *even when no `Makefile` exists*. Type `make main.o` in a directory with `main.c` and no `Makefile` and see what happens.

Users can change the value of the variable `CC`, thus changing the compiler used by such implicit rules.
