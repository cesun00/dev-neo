GCC C/C++ shares the same preprocessor program `cpp`. Several of its primary functionalities are discussed.

Search for headers
---------------

### Standard header search pathes

Standard header search pathes can be found by:

```sh
# gcc -v -xc /dev/null |& grep -A 8 'search starts'
#include "..." search starts here:
#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/include
 /usr/local/include
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/include-fixed
 /usr/include
End of search list.
GNU C17 (GCC) version 10.2.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
	compiled by GNU C version 10.2.0, GMP version 6.2.0, MPFR version 4.1.0, MPC version 1.1.0, isl version isl-0.21-GMP

# gcc -v -xc++ /dev/null |& grep -A 8 'search starts'
#include "..." search starts here:
#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/../../../../include/c++/10.2.0
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/../../../../include/c++/10.2.0/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/../../../../include/c++/10.2.0/backward
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/include
 /usr/local/include
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/include-fixed
 /usr/include
End of search list.
```

Note that when compiling for C++, C++-specific headers are always in the front.

Among those header search paths:

1. `/usr/local/include` can be changed by the `--with-local-prefix=dirname` flag of the `configure` script when buliding gcc.
2. `/usr/include` can be changed by the `--with-native-system-header-dir=dirname` flag of the `configure` script when buliding gcc.
3. I think `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/include` and `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/include-fixed`, and the ordering of the paths, are hardcoded into `cpp`. And C++-specific header paths are passed to `cpp` by `cc1plus` upon fork-exec. The built-in specs of gcc does not have flags for these.

`-nostdinc++` turns off all C++ specific standard header search path. `-nostdinc` turns off all standard header search path, leaving a blank start for the CLI flags controlling header search path listed below.


### CLI flags that affects header search

Quote include search starts from 1.

Angle bracket include search starts from 3.

1. The current directory of the source file.
2. `-iquote` left to right.
3. `-I` left to right.
4. `-isystem` left to right.
5. Standard header search paths.
6. `-idirafter` left to right.



## Macro Expansion

- Object-like macro, e.g. `#define A (X,Y,Z)`, establish a rule of replacement between a preprocessor token `X` and an ordered list of preprocessor tokens `X COMMA Y COMMA Z`.
- Function-like macro, e.g. `#define A(X) (X,Y,Z)`, is simply a parameterized object-like macro.

Those rules of replacement are between preprocessor tokens. Recursive expansion happens *lazily* only upon the invocation of a macro (regardless object / function macro): its expansion replaces the i7

```c
// It's okay to have undefined BAR when `#define FOO`, ...

#define FOO BAR
#define BAR 42

// as long as BAR is known at expansion time
printf("%d\n", FOO);
```

Inside a function macro's expansion body, parameter will be replaced by whatever token used as argument, yet not further expanded until the next iteration of expansion. This make possible some operators on the parameter of function-alike macro:

- `#` stringizes a preprocessor token into a double-quoted C string literal.

    ```c
    #define A(X) (X,#X)
    #define FOO 42

    A(FOO);
    // expand to        (FOO, "FOO")
    // then expand to   (42, )
    ```

- `##` concatenates 2 preprocessor tokens before further expansion:

    ```c
    #define FOOGG 4233
    #define A(X,Y) X##Y

    A(FOO,GG)
    // expand to        (FOOGG)
    // then expand to   (4233)
    ```

Apart from their original purpose, these 2 operator has the side effect:

> After the arguments for the invocation of a function-like macro have been identified, argument substitution takes place. A parameter in the replacement list, unless preceded by a # or ## preprocessing token or followed by a ## preprocessing token (see below), is replaced by the corresponding argument after all macros contained therein have been expanded. Before being substituted, each argumentâ€™s preprocessing tokens are completely macro replaced as if they formed the rest of the preprocessing file; no other preprocessing tokens are available.
