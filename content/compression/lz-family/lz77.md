I recently went through [the original paper of LZ77](https://courses.cs.duke.edu/spring03/cps296.5/papers/ziv_lempel_1977_universal_algorithm.pdf)
so it might be a good chance to put down some synopsis and ideas.

LZ77 was proposed in an age when compression algorithms are studied in the name of encoding and decoding processes.
Terminologies were aligned with the classic coding theory. See []


## The vanilla Ziv Lempel 1977

The following discussion uses notations from the lz77 paper in best effort.
Some definitions are re-phrased.

LZ77 is a compression algorithm that takes input string `S` and output string `C`.

Lz77 assumes an alphabet of `α` symbols, denoted `{0,1,..., α-1}`.

Input is defined as a string on this alphabet, and the compression process is parameterized by 2 config values, depending on how much
computation resources you are willing to
- `L_s`: the 
- `n`: sliding window size. A buffer of this size must be allocated in memory during compression / decompression.
  The paper recommended an choice of `n` approx equal to `L_s * α ^( h * L_s)` where `h ∈ `

Given a string `S` of length `l`, we define a function `REPEXT(S, j)` (where `j < l`) to be the longest prefix starting at `S[j+1]`
which is also a substring somewhere embedded in `S[1, j]`.
